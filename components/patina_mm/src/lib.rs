//! ## MM Technology Background (x86 Architecture)
//!
//! System Management Mode (SMM) or Management Mode (MM) is a special-purpose operating mode in x86 architecture
//! with high execution privilege that is used to monitor and manage various system resources. MM code is often
//! written similarly to non-MM UEFI Code, built with the same toolset and included alongside non-MM UEFI code in
//! the same firmware image. However, MM code executes in a special region of memory that is isolated from the rest
//! of the system, and it is not directly accessible to the operating system or other software running on the system.
//!
//! This region is called System Management RAM (SMRAM) or Management Mode RAM (MMRAM). Since this region is isolated,
//! constructs from the DXE environment like boot services, runtime services, and the DXE protocol database are not
//! available in MM. Instead, MM code uses its own services table and protocol data entirely managed in MMRAM.
//!
//! MM is entered on a system by triggering a System Management Interrupt (SMI) also called a Management Mode
//! Interrupt (MMI). The MMI may be either triggered by software (synchronous) or a hardware (asynchronous) event. A
//! MMI is a high priority, non-maskable interrupt. On receipt of the interrupt, the processor saves the current state
//! of the system and switches to MM. Within MM, the code must set up its own execution environment such as applying
//! an interupt descriptor table (IDT), creating page tables, etc. It must also identify the source of the MMI to
//! determine what MMI handler to invoke in response.
//!
//! Recently, there has been an effort to reduce and even eliminate the use of MM in modern systems. MM represents a
//! large attack surface because of its pervasiveness throughout the system lifetime. It is especially impactful if
//! compromised due to its ubiquity and system access privilege. A vulnerability in a given MM implementation could
//! further be used to compromise or circumvent OS protections such as Virtualization-based Security (VBS). Based on
//! the current use cases for MM and available alternatives, it is not possible to completely eliminate MM from
//! modern systems.
//!
//! ## Examples and Usage
//!
//! This example demonstrates how to use the `MmCommunication` service to communicate with the
//! [MM Supervisor](https://github.com/microsoft/mu_feature_mm_supv). The MM Supervisor has a MMI handler that will
//! respond to requests for information about the MM Supervisor itself, such as its version and capabilities.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use patina_mm::service::MmCommunication;
//! use patina::component::{IntoComponent, service::Service};
//! use r_efi::efi;
//!
//! /// MM Supervisor Request Header
//! ///
//! /// Used to request information from the MM Supervisor.
//! ///
//! /// ## Notes
//! ///
//! /// - This structure is only defined here for test purposes.
//! #[repr(C, packed(1))]
//! struct MmSupervisorRequestHeader {
//!     signature: u32,
//!     revision: u32,
//!     request: u32,
//!     reserved: u32,
//!     result: u64,
//! }
//!
//! /// MM Supervisor Version Info
//! ///
//! /// Populated by the MM Supervisor in response to a version request.
//! ///
//! /// ## Notes
//! ///
//! /// - This structure is only defined here for test purposes.
//! #[repr(C, packed(1))]
//! struct MmSupervisorVersionInfo {
//!     version: u32,
//!     patch_level: u32,
//!     max_supervisor_request_level: u64,
//! }
//!
//! /// QEMU Q35 MM Test Component
